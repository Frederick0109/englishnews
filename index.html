    <h1>Breaking News: Donkeys Can Fly!</h1>

      <p>In an unprecedented event, scientists claim to have discovered a breed of donkeys capable of flying. This
        discovery, made in a remote region of the world, is making headlines across the globe. According to reports,
        these donkeys use a special type of wings hidden under their fur.</p>
      <p>"We never thought it was possible," said Dr. Jane Smith, head of the project. "We're still trying to understand
        how this happened."</p>
      <p>The announcement has sparked curiosity and skepticism in the international scientific community. Many are
        demanding further evidence to validate the discovery.</p>
      <p>Experts are currently analyzing the biological structure of these flying donkeys to determine the evolutionary
        process that led to their unique capability. Preliminary findings suggest a genetic mutation that may have occurred
        thousands of years ago.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, locals in the region where the donkeys were found have reported seeing these animals soar above the
        landscape, describing the sight as both astonishing and beautiful. "It's like something out of a fairy tale," said
        one villager.</p>
      <p>The government has stepped in to protect these creatures, declaring the area a national reserve to prevent poaching
        and to allow scientists to conduct their research in peace. The world waits eagerly for further updates on this
        incredible discovery, which could potentially change our understanding of animal capabilities.</p>
